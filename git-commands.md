#git commands  
  
`git init`  
Before you can make commits or do anything else with a git repository, the repository needs to actually exist.
To create a new repository with Git, we'll use the `git init` command.  
  
The `init` subcommand is short for "initialize", which is helpful because it's the command that will do all of the 
initial setup of a repository.
